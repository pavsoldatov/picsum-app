A CRUD app that enables a user to view photos, add to/remove from favorites, change the per page amount of shown photos. The app should work on the last 3 browser versions that support es6 modules. Photos are fetched from [picsum.photos](https://picsum.photos/) which in turn serves them from unsplash.

How to run this app:
1. Clone the repo,
2. `npm install` the dependencies.
3. `npm run dev` to test the app locally on host `http://127.0.0.1:5173/`

OR you can just go to a live version:
